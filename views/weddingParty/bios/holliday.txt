Amy has been a long time friend of Timâ€™s since middle school and we first crossed paths in high school bonding over a love for lord of the rings. I remember how we started to read off lines in elvish to share our quirky obsession with Tolkien lore. She is also a fellow Harry Potter fanatic and enjoys playing video games. We have had a lot of fun going out enjoying hard ciders, watching movies, and hiking the beautiful Cascade Mountains in the Pacific Northwest! She has supported Tim and I for many years and is always there when we need her. She is currently a teacher in Washington state and loves to go hiking, running, and travels all over the world (she recently went to New Zealand for which I am incredibly jealous!) Tim and I are excited that she is taking the time to come and be a part of our big day!
