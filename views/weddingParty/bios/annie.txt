I connected with Annie over a Disney intern facebook group back when I was trying to find a place to live in Florida for the Disney internship. We became roommates and we had an enormous amount of fun during the 6 months as we are both HUGE Disney fanatics and all things Harry Potter, Britain, and especially Law & Order SVU. We went to so many Illumination fireworks shows that I can’t help but think of her when I watch it! We also enjoyed lots of character interactions at WDW and she is OBSESSED with Pineapple Dole Whip ice cream! We became very close and I was fortunate enough to see her frequently when I visited WDW periodically during veterinary school. She has a spunky personality with a huge crush on JT and David Tennant and has run several half marathons for Disney (I’m so proud of her)! She is currently working in beautiful Disneyland and I am so ecstatic to have her by my side!
