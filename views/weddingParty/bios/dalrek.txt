In just a few short months, Dalrek will be my new brother- and I couldn’t be more excited. I have two very distinct and fond memories of Dalrek, The first isn’t anytime in particular, but more or less every single time we went out for drinks on the Ave or around the UW. We all have a seat at Finn’s, A-Pizza-Place, or whatever random bar we’d wind up at that night and everyone would order a beer or cocktail… but not Dalrek. Dalreak would always start the night off with an AMF, a drink that would take me out for the night on a good day, and go from there. It was impressive to say the least.

The second was when we were hanging out at his house in Redmond. We were just sitting at the dining room table, I was working on my laptop and he was drawing/painting across the table and I remember at one point he just hammers out about a dozen sketches, any of which I could have spent several days trying to replicate and never get close, in what felt like 10 minutes. It was absolutely incredible.

I’m excited to be able to call Dalrek my brother, and hope our paths lead us closer again one day so it won’t have to take a 3,000 mile flight to be able to grab a drink together again.
