Karen is one of my best friends in life that I met in university while we were working at Redwood Animal Hospital. We discovered that we were in similar classes and after that developed a very close relationship that has lasted through some very crazy times! When we both got into veterinary school we knew it would be fun rooming together and I remember all of the times we spent glued to Netflix, dancing in our living room, eating McDonald’s after late nights of studying, and trying not to sleep in early morning theriogenology class. Our weekend “activity” of shopping at the local Walmart brought a lot of laughs in the four years of emotional and mental turmoil that was veterinary school, and I’m grateful for all the love and support she has given me. She has accepted me for all that I am and I am so glad to have her share this experience with me. We have traveled to many places including Disney World and Nicaragua, and I hope one day to finally take our girls’ trip to Santorini, Greece! Karen is working as an emergency veterinarian currently in Vancouver Washington.
