Nick is my fearless younger brother. Whether it’s performing on stage in front of thousands or singing a karaoke song you’ve never heard before (sorry about that), I’ve never seen Nick back down from a challenge and it continues to inspire me to challenge myself every single day. Seriously, I will literally think to myself, “Nick wouldn’t even hesitate to do this” anytime I think something is too hard and I’m thinking of just skipping out.

Nick is also one of the most dedicated and passionate people I know. I feel like he’s been cooking since before I can remember, and every time I get a chance to visit him, he has some new delectable master-chef level feast prepared. When he’s not cooking, he’s drumming; teaching, practicing, or competing in the world championship in Edinburgh, Scotland. It is impossible for me to hear the snap of a snare or hum of a bagpipe without thinking of Nick.

Nick and I have always been close, even when we’re living 3,000 miles apart, and I swear we could be telepathic when it comes to Taboo. Nick is one of my closest friends, a constant inspiration, and I am grateful to be his brother.
