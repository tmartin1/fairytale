Chelsea and I met at COLE (cougar orientation and leadership experience) prior to starting veterinary school. She was also graduated from University of Washington who sought out Karen and me as fellow huskies and we all became close throughout veterinary school. We bonded heavily over rom coms, romantic period pieces and several wonderfully delicious glasses of wine! Chelsea has helped me through many tough times during my veterinary career especially as someone who was experiencing a long distance relationship, and I was honored to be a part of her wedding last fall. There were many a nights we would talk forever while snacking on McDonald’s French fries and/or popcorn. My wedding day wouldn’t be the same without her around and I am thrilled to have her as a bridesmaid! She is currently completing her equine surgical internship at Tufts University and I know she’s doing to be an amazing Equine surgeon one day!
