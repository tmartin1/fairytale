Aralyn is my wonderful younger sister that has of course known me my whole life.  She has supported me through the rough patches and cheers me on through the fun times.  She has a shared passion for Disney and we both have been to Disneyland together since we were young kids (her favorite rides are the Haunted Mansion and Thunder Mountain).  She has impressed me every day as she plays the violin beautifully, and it brought me to tears when I saw her play several Disney soundtracks at her high school recital 5 years ago. She has a love for animals and her compassion is what inspires me to do my job to the fullest. She cares deeply about her family (even though she may often do it in peaceful silence) and spends a lot of her time with our familyâ€™s three dachshunds Merrilee, Tucker, and Tinkerbell.  She is currently studying screenplay and film critique and is living in beautiful Washington State.
