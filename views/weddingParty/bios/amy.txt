I met Amy while working at Disney’s Animal Kingdom as we were fellow wildlife “professional interns” at the veterinary hospital. We instantly clicked and were laughing goofballs the entire internship to the point where it started driving the fellow cast members nutty that we got along so well. We were so lucky to have seen so many cool animals up close, and shared memories and experiences that were truly once in a lifetime! We spent a lot of fun times staying out taking drawing classes at the Art of Animation, watching the Magic Kingdom fireworks, and meeting several of the famous Disney characters. Thanks to her I know what a goats bleat sounds like and that a Labrador can be taught to do a hand stand! She has been a great friend and I can’t wait to have her part of the big day! Amy is currently working as a veterinarian in Tallahassee Florida enjoying time with her husband Tripp and her two adorable pups!
