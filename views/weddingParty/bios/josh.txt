I’ve known Josh for almost 10 years, and had the pleasure of getting to live with him for 7 of those glorious years. We met at the University of Washington, when, by the recommendation of a wonderful mutual friend of ours, Amy Holliday, he joined me at the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. Through classes, study tables, some kabrewing, the occasional keg stand, and other miscellaneous adventures, we found we made a pretty great team.

From there, we started a long and arduous era managing a nearby apartment complex together while we finished up our studies at the UW, and ultimately for several years after we graduated. I could go on for hours reminiscing about all the crazy stories and memories from that place, but what I’ll always cherish are the endless hours of League of Legends (streaming LSC when we couldn’t play), watching the Seahawks and Sounders, going to Shultzy’s, meetings with Mindy, and maybe most of all, all the times we just relaxed and kicked back with a nice cold HighLife.

Josh is unquestionably one of the most kind, caring, and hardworking individuals on the planet. Wrapping up his first year of medical school, he’s on his way to becoming an incredible physician and I couldn’t be more proud to be able to call him my friend.
