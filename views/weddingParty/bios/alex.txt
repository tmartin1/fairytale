Alex is, without a doubt, one of the most generous and caring individuals I’ve ever known. For as long as I can remember, he is always the first to go out of his way to help anyone in need.

I’ve had the pleasure of getting to share my entire life with Alex, and thinking back, there is one thing that has always remained constant: we’ve always found time to lose ourselves in good video games together. I believe it started back in elementary school, when we would get up at 4am so we could get a game of Age of Empires in before school started. Age of Empires turned into Counterstrike, and eventually, of course, World of Warcraft. Alex was our fearless guild leader for several years, leading dungeon raids and battling the alliance on the battlegrounds. Now he has a new house and new fiancee (congrats!!) and still manages to make time to help our tribe build our fortress and fend of the dinosaurs of Ark.

Gaming aside, Alex is always there to talk to, offer advice and wisdom, support me in times of struggle, and believe in me. Alex is a true friend, and I can’t image a better older brother.
