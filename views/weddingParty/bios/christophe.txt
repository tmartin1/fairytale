I first met Christophe in middle school, I remember weekend long LAN parties, loaded with caffeine and playing Counter Strike into the wee hours of the morning. We also battled on the tennis court for several years and while I’d manage to win the occasional match, Christophe was always just a little, tiny, virtually immeasurably bit better, well, according to him at least.

After high school, Christophe moved back to Belgium, which sucked, but also meant I had a free place to stay when I went to visit Belgium last summer (I know, it took me way too long to get out there, but better late than never, right?) I got to see Brussels, Antwerp, Amsterdam, the Westvleteren Brewery, and the most adorable town I’ve ever seen in my life: Bruges. On top of all the beautiful sights, there was beer. Incredible beer. And Christophe graciously made sure that I got to enjoy a different and delicious new Belgium beer with every meal (and snack) of the day.

For all the time and change life has brought in the last 16 years... we still find ourselves playing video games way too late into the night; not so much Counterstrike anymore, but rather hunting dinosaurs and building fortresses in a thrilling new addiction, Ark.
