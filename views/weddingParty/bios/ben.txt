Ana and Tim have known Ben since high school, in times filled with far too much juvenile shenanigans (nothing too terrible-- our shenanigans are cheeky and fun) and through this they developed a lifelong friendship. In the beginning they spent their days riding their motorcycles around Western Washington and their nights at the infamous barn or the Redmond Pool. More recently, their time- when they're not working- is filled with much more tame shenanigans in the form of video games.

While their paths diverged for a time after high school, they were never far out of touch. Ben is currently getting his PhD in Botany at Washington State University and claims to actually enjoy living out in Pullman, Washington, much to the disbelief on Ana, who "suffered" for four years there for Vet School.

Through his Ben has always been a trusted ally and one of our closest friends and even though we're thousands of miles away, we'll always be close and we could not be more excited for Ben to unite us in marriage and pronounce us as husband and wife.
