Elliott and I first met at the University of Washington as fraternity brothers. I remember spending almost every afternoon at the IMA (shout out to Kelsey for cracking the whip and keeping us from getting too fat) and hiking around the beautiful state of Washington on the weekends… or at least a few weekends. Thinking back, there were a lot of firsts with Elliott: the first batch of beer I ever brewed (I still have two very old bottles of that smokey porter), my first Magic the Gathering draft tournament, first time blacking out on mimosas at 9am before that tragic super bowl event.

A couple years after we graduated the UW, Elliott did something that would end up changing my life forever. Unhappy with his career, he quit and went to this programming bootcamp thing called Hack Reactor (6 days/week 12 hours/day of coding). I remember him encouraging me to get back into programming with him when he was preparing for it, but honestly, I was scared and filled my time with my work in finance. Unsurprisingly, Elliott finished Hack Reactor and got an amazing new job in San Francisco. Long story short, he inspired me to follow in his footsteps. I quit my job, moved in with Elliott in San Francisco, and started Hack Reactor. After a few months of coding, Lagunitas, and trips to Trader Joes, I finished Hack Reactor, got a new job, and couldn’t be happier. And in all seriousness. I couldn’t have done it without the kindness and support of Elliott.
