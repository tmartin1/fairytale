Jacquie and I became friends in high school when we both joined the gymnastics team for fun! She was performing floor routines while I scarily braved the beam for every meet. We became very close and were fortunate enough to go to the same undergraduate university (GO DAWGS!) where we continued to go on fun adventures and enjoy time out under the cherry blossoms. She even knew Tim long before I met him back in middle school and they were close friends for quite some time before I came into the scene. I remember the day after Tim and I went to dinner for the first time and she screamed in excitement for us both (even though at the time I wasnâ€™t quite sure about Tim haha). It would seem she always knew we would work out well and she continues to be a supportive friend for both of us and I am so happy she will be part of my wedding party. She is currently a case management trainer in the Pacific Northwest.
