I believe that Tim Harris is the most intelligent, charismatic, and important people he’s ever known. Ha. Tim and I also met at the University of Washington, as fellow Phi Delts. From the first moment we met, Tim had an aire of confidence and determination and even though he didn’t want me to be his ‘little bro’ (because my name is also “Tim” and “that would be weird”), we somehow managed to remain friends.

I’ve never known Tim to allow himself ,or those he cares for, to settle for anything less than their absolute best, and more often, even more than that. He drives himself and those around him to be the best versions of themselves they can be. At this point, I’m certain he derives all his power and drive from through a careful combination of what seems to be as much Starbucks and Tanqueray as possible, although I have no idea how, I know it has to be true.

Tim has always been a great friend; honest, encouraging, and inspiring. As he nears the culmination of his first year of medical school, I have no doubt that he will change the world medicine and I look forward to all the years to come.
