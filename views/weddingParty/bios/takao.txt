Takao has been a longtime best friend of Tim and Ana, and it’s safe to say that without him their relationship may have never happened. Takao and Ana were close friends since 6th grade enjoying nerdy video games and movies together and suffering through honors classes until their brains would give out.  One lucky day Takao decided to invite Ana out to hang in Kingston for a fun 4th of July party since Ana was going through a rough patch in high school, and being the guardian angel that he was, he wanted to bring a smile to her face. That very party was when the love between Tim and Ana began.

Takao is the type of person that has always put others before him, and strives to make others happy. Ana has always been grateful for his kindness, and looked to him for guidance during times of stress and uncertainty even when he lived 3000 miles away. Tim and Ana have often bonded with Takao over computers and video games as well. Takao is currently residing in Boston where he has excitingly finished graduate school with a Masters of Computer Engineering, for which Tim and Ana could not be more proud of him!! Takao has been a huge support to the happy couple since the beginning, and because of that they have chosen him to be their master of ceremony and help them “tie the knot” literally by performing their hand-fasting ceremony. They love him dearly, and are ecstatic to share their happy day with him and many more fun events to come!
