Explore exciting attractions, enchanting international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special events. Celebrating the human spirit, Epcot has 2 distinct realms: Future World, which features technological innovations, and World Showcase, which shares with Guests the culture and cuisine of 11 countries: Mexico, Norway, China, Germany, Italy, the United States, Japan, Morocco, France, United Kingdom and Canada.

<br>
While it doesn’t feel like a typical theme park, EPCOT is comprised of two separate sections: Future World and World Showcase. Future World is where you’ll find most the rides, while the World Showcase is home to 11 country-themed pavilions with dining and shopping experiences.
