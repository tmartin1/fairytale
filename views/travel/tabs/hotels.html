        There are a lot of fantastic places to stay  during your time at Disney World. All
        official Disney resorts <!-- Add popover with explanation -->
        offer amazing benefits including complimentary transportation and luggage handling from Orlando
        International Airport via Disney’s Magical Express. You just walk off the plane and head
        straight to the bus- they’ll even deliver your bags to your hotel room for you!
