    <h2>Will there be any dancing at the reception?</h2>
    <p>
        Absolutely! There will be plenty of opportunities to show off your dance moves. Seriously,
        we've recently started taking up ballroom dancing, and while we're not any good, we still
        love to dance- and would love for you to join us out on the dance floor. So dust off those
        shoes and get ready to waltz, foxtrot, rumba, and swing!

    <h2>Multi-day park tickets <b>DON'T</b> have to be used on consecutive days</h2>
    <p>
        For example, if you get a 4 day park hopper ticket, you can go to the park Thursday, Friday,
        relax on Saturday, and then go back Sunday and Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only restriction is that you have to use the tickets within 14 days of the first day.
        Meaning you couldn't take that 4-day ticket and go to Magic Kingdom on say, Thursday, June
        23rd; then you would have to use the remaining 3 days before Thursday, July 7th.

    <h2>FastPasses</h2>
    <p>
        First, FastPasses are FREE. They are included with your park ticket. You can book up to
        three fastpasses per day to start and you can get more after you use the first three you
        booked.
    </p>
    <p>
        How do you book your fastpasses? You go to <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/plan/">
        your MyDisneyExperience Account</a> and click the FastPass+ link in the right dropdown menu.
        This is also where you can make dinning reservations, check/update hotel reservations, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>SUPER IMPORTANT:</b> If you're staying at a Disney World hotel, you can book fastpasses
        as soon as 60 days before your first night. This is important, because if you don't want to
        wait 2 hours to ride the awesome roller coasters, you want to set a reminder to book your
        fastpasses at that 60 day mark.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Magic Band is your key to everything Disney</h2>
    <p>
        After you book your hotel reservation, Disney will send you a Magic Band! Your Magic Band
        is your hotel key, your park ticket, your fastpass, your photopass, the thing they scan for
        any dinning reservations, the thing you can use to pay for stuff (you have the option to
        link a card to it to use it to pay for anything in the parks), and probably even more cool
        stuff that I'm forgetting at the moment.
