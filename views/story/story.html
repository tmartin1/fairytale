        The tale of Tim and Ana begins back in 2004. Tim was in his junior year of high school and Ana, a senior was getting ready to graduate and start her studies at the University of Washington. The first time they met was in a forensic science class and the first thing they ever talked about? Enemas. Neither remembers quite how it came up, but as it turned out, they had both recently undergone appendectomies and if you’ve been through that, you know exactly what I’m talking about. Unsurprisingly, that wasn’t quite the spark that kicked off their beautiful relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was just a couple months later that they met again. You see, Ana was in the same grade as Tim’s older brother, Alex, and they had been friends through high school and had several classes together. On this occasion, Ana and Takao were over at Alex’s house working on a physics project. Being a younger brother, Tim spent that afternoon being obnoxious and annoying his older brother. Ana remembers a good deal of flirting between her and Tim, although Tim, probably too focused on being an annoying little brother, was oblivious to any flirting by either party.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, at a 4th of July party out in Kingston, WA, they met again. Ana and Tim talked on the beach for several hours and Tim decided he needed to win Ana’s affection. So naturally, Tim began flirting with her in a way that was so awkward, Ana admits she didn’t even know it was happening until Stephanie told her. The following day, Tim nervously surprised Ana at work and they went on their first date at Thai Ginger that evening. Ana is still adamant that July 5th was ‘just dinner’, and that they didn’t ‘officially’ start dating until August 17, 2005.

        Their relationship grew during Ana’s first year at college and the following Spring, Tim was accepted into the University of Washington as well! Tim joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity his first quarter at the UW and he and Ana were able to see each other almost every day. They enjoyed many parties, video game events with friends, trips to Gaswork parks on a routine basis and even went to Puerto Vallarta. Early on in their relationship they were fortunate enough to go on their first Disneyland trip together and it was that trip that sparked Tim’s passion for Disney life (a certain requirement for Ana). Their love for Disney and all its magic grew together throughout the years as they would take several trips to Disney for fun.
    </p>
    <p>
        These four years were a huge part of their development as a couple because they both faced multiple dream career changes (*Gasp* could it be, that Ana didn’t always want to be a Vet and initially dreamt of being an animator for Walt Disney Studios?) ...and Tim just had no idea at all what he wanted to do and pretty much changed his mind every quarter (physician, architect, software engineer, mechanical engineer, economist, etc.) Through it all, Tim and Ana were always supportive of one another’s pursuits and when it came time to face the reality of Ana’s career choice in veterinary medicine, Tim was ecstatic and encouraging- even though it would likely mean a lot of moving and uncertainty. Immediately graduating from university Ana was accepted to a 6 month dream job at Walt Disney World’s Animal Kingdom, and it was then that Tim and Ana started their 6 year quest of surviving a long distance relationship.

        During Ana’s time at Disney’s Animal Kingdom, she was accepted into the Washington State University Veterinary School waaaaaaay over in Pullman, Washington. While this was a good 5-6 hours from Seattle, it was still a great deal closer than Florida.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next four years were extremely tough with large amounts of stress on both fronts, and the lost distance only made it harder. It was the small surprise visits coordinated by both parties that kept their romance and love for one another alive. One time Tim got to Pullman so late in the middle of night during a snowstorm that he threw snowballs at Ana’s window to wake her up. She was so excited to see him she ran outside in the freezing cold in her PJs. Date nights in Azeroth also helped, fighting the Alliance in the Arathi Basin, battling the armies of the Lich King, Arthas, and keeping Deathwing from tearing the world apart (they played World of Warcraft together). They tried to appreciate the little moments every weekend they spent together and couldn’t wait for the schooling to end. There would be many late nights of Ana’s hysterical crying about how tough the exams were or Tim’s hysterical crying about the difficulties of co-founding a company without any prior savings, but they would try and inspire each other to keep fighting through their obstacles. Times weren’t always easy, and it took a lot of adjustment, compromise, and patience to get used to the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
        As Ana reached the end of her first year of veterinary school, Tim neared his graduation from the University of Washington. Never really settling on what he wanted to do, Tim ended up graduating with degrees in applied math and economics and joined a team of financial advisors in Seattle with North Star Resource Group. Always passionate about helping people, Tim, along with his team, founded a new financial advising firm, Finity Group, that was independent of insurance and investment companies so they could actually help people in an unbiased way… and this is when Tim learned how difficult it can be to start a company from the ground up.

    <p>
        It wasn’t all hardship and sob stories- a huge moment in their relationship came that summer after that first year of vet school ended.
    </p>


    <h2>An Enchanting Engagement</h2>
    <p>
        Following Tim’s graduation and the completion of Ana’s first year of vet school, they decided to go on a nine day trip to Disney World! On their second day they started at Animal Kingdom and after suffering through the almost unbearable heat they became exhausted and decided to nap at their hotel before braving the weather that evening. Ana thought it would be fun to go to Downtown Disney to watch a movie and changed into some casual clothes when Tim exclaimed “Would Cinderella wear that to her royal table?”
    </p>
    <p>
        Ana was very confused at first and Tim revealed that they were celebrating their anniversary dinner in Cinderella’s castle that evening (celebrating 6 years together)! Ecstatic, Ana got dressed up and started getting ready with hair and makeup. During this time, Tim suspiciously walked in and out of the hotel room to make phone calls, leaving Ana wondering what the rest of the night would entail. When they made it to the castle, they were greeted by Cinderella as they waited for their royal announcements (and yes royal as in “Prince Timothy and Princess Anastacia your table is ready”).
    </p>
    <p>
        The scenery was breathtaking; the intricate details of medieval architecture containing baroque style archways with incredible stained glass windows made everything seem like a fairytale dream. The princesses were seen mingling amongst the tables and they were just as gorgeous as the movies portray them. They were so excited because their table was next to a stained glass window in the front of the castle where they would be able to see the “Wishes” fireworks show. They ordered their appetizers and, hungry from the heat of the day, Ana could not wait to devour her salad, however Tim barely touched his... Tim excused himself and went to the restroom for what Ana felt like forever, meanwhile she tried to contact her family to tell them how lucky she was to be eating in the castle (who sadly did not answer).
    </p>
    <p>
        Tim sat down at the table and Ana said “Hey I tried calling my mom but she didn’t answer, I wanted to tell her the awesome surprise dinner you reserved!” and Tim responded, “Ana, they already know you’re here.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Ana’s thoughts whirled in confusion and butterflies rose in her stomach as Tim began his proposal speech. He brought Ana to her feet, got down on one knee, and recanted his affection and love for her. Ana was nervous and light headed all the while distracted by an exuberant middle aged woman behind Tim shouting “Oh my God it’s happening!!!” while flashing her camera at the couple. Ana said “Yes.” Not a moment later fireworks light up the night sky and the Wishes Celebration music filled the royal hall. They were treated to champagne and a delectable chocolate dessert served in a glass slipper as we enjoyed the rest of their favorite Disney Celebration as fiancés.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the fireworks; Cinderella, Belle, Ariel, Snow White, and Princess Aurora all visited their table to congratulate us on their engagement. With another stroke of luck, Magic Kingdom was open extra late that night and they got to stay until 3:30 the next morning, enjoying all of their favorite rides and rollercoasters.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following morning Tim was eager to wake Ana up and rush to EPCOT, however as they had not returned to the hotel until 4:30 that morning, Ana was reluctant to wake… and very difficult to motivate. Tim did finally dragged her to the park and right away ventured to the animation studio, while Ana loved the artwork of Disney, she was still very confused as to why this was a priority. The manager greeted them and asked Ana if she would like to be the honorary Disney Artist of the Day- surprised and excited, Ana eagerly responded “Yes!”
    </p>
    <p>
        Ana worked on her sketch in the front of the store while Tim disappeared mysteriously for a time- not that Ana noticed. Being the perfectionist she is, Ana was never fully satisfied with her sketch. She did eventually turn it over to the cast member, who placed the artwork in a frame behind a luxurious velvet curtain. The cast member began to play trumpeting music from a stereo and announced the reveal of her artwork to guests that walked into the store. Screams of excitement and joy erupted from the back of the studio as the artwork was revealed and Ana was shocked to find some of their closest friends jump out from their hiding places. Tim surprised her once again as he explained he set up a whole weekend of adventure with friends and family to celebrate their engagement. The rest of the weekend was truly magical and they never wanted to leave.
    </p>


    <h2>Back to Reality (aka "What the hell am I doing?")</h2>
    <p>
        Vet school was coming to a close (3 years later, now 2014) and Ana was matched to an internship at Seattle Veterinary Specialists in Kirkland, WA. Tim and Ana were excited to finally be living in the same city after 5 years apart. Initially it was wonderful as they got to behave like a normal couple going to dinner, watching movies together, and spending time with family and friends.
    </p>
    <p>
        With Ana confidently moving forward with her career, Tim had started to question his. Starting a company from nothing had its toll on everyone (food stamps, housing assistance, loans, etc. aren’t all fun and games) and it felt like environment and attitude of Finity Group had changed to be more like that of any other financial advising company: where helping our clients took second priority to making sales. Long story short, it was time to move on. After serving Finity Group as their CTO, along with some academic experience in computer science and an active interest software development, all it took was a little push from a close friend to get Tim to move down to San Francisco and pursue a career as a software engineer. So of course, right when they were able to be together again, they decide to make life a little harder again by moving apart for another 7-8 months.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thanks to the incredible support of Ana, his friends, and family, Tim was accepted to and graduated from Hack Reactor, a grueling and unbelievably exciting 13 week software bootcamp; 6 days per week, 12 hours a day of beautiful JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        As Tim was finishing up at Hack Reactor, Ana was matched to a surgery internship in Coral Springs, FL (about 2-3 hours south of Orlando and an hour north of Miami for those that are lost). Both nervous about the big move away from friends and family, they went forward with eagerness, support, love, and optimism. As fortune would have it, Tim was able to find an excellent software engineering job only 20 minutes from Ana’s work with an incredible team of people. In their time in Florida, they have made wonderful new friends, enjoyed the beach a few times (although surprisingly not as much as one would expect living 8 min from the coast), and weekend trips up to Disney World as often as they can manage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through all the obstacles and challenges, their love of one another and their determination to keep each other happy through all the tough times has made their relationship strong. Their quirky obsession for Lord of the Rings, video games, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, and most importantly Disney has kept them entertained and inspired to have imaginative lives and learn to be optimistic in the most stressful times. They are grateful to have been together for over 10 years, and are thrilled to finally become husband and wife this summer.
